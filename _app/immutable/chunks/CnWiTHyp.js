German psychologists Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Wolfgang Kohler created the Gestalt Principles in the 1920s.

Just like good UX, most dark patterns are invisible to users. But unlike good UX, dark patterns benefit the company (rather than the user) by using deception as a tool for conversion. UK–based UX designer Harry Brignull first coined the term in 2010, defining dark patterns as “a user interface that has been carefully crafted to trick users into doing things, such as buying insurance with their purchase or signing up for recurring bills."}],quizzes:[{name:"Colour Theory Quiz",content:"",question1:"Question 1: What colour means angry?",answer1_1:"Red",answer1_2:"Blue",answer1_3:"Orange",question2:"Question 2: What colour means sad?",answer2_1:"Pink",answer2_2:"Purple",answer2_3:"Blue",question3:"Question 3: What colour is associated with the sun?",answer3_1:"Yellow",answer3_2:"Purple",answer3_3:"Orange",question4:"Question 4: What colour is associated with earth?",answer4_1:"Red",answer4_2:"Brown",answer4_3:"Yellow"},{name:"Gamification Quiz",content:"",question1:"Question 1: What is Gamification?",answer1_1:"The use of game-like graphics and animations in non-game websites and apps.",answer1_2:"The application of game mechanics to motivate engagement.",answer1_3:"The practice of using physical games to teach important life skills and lessons.",question2:"Question 2: What is the primary goal of gamification?",answer2_1:"To create fully functional video games for educational purposes",answer2_2:"To make everyday tasks more competitive",answer2_3:"To apply game design elements to non-game contexts to increase engagement and motivation",question3:"Question 3: Which of the following is NOT a typical element of gamification?",answer3_1:"High-end graphics for video games",answer3_2:"Rewrds and badges",answer3_3:"Leaderboards",question4:"Question 4:  Gamification is most commonly used in which of the following areas?",answer4_1:"Only in video game development ",answer4_2:"In education, marketing and employee engagement",answer4_3:"In competitive sports leagues"},{name:"Gestalt Quiz",content:"",question1:"Question 1: How many Gestalt Principles are there?",answer1_1:"6",answer1_2:"3",answer1_3:"10",question2:"Question 2: Where were the gestalt princples created?",answer2_1:"Ireland and Wales",answer2_2:"Norway and Sweden",answer2_3:"Germany and Austria",question3:"Question 3: Which Gestalt Principle talks about optical illusions?",answer3_1:"Closure",answer3_2:"Proximity",answer3_3:"Symetry",question4:"Question 4: Which Gestalt Principle talks about having related items in one area?",answer4_1:"Closure",answer4_2:"Proximity",answer4_3:"Symetry"},{name:"Dark Patterns Quiz",content:"",question1:"Question 1: What is a 'dark pattern' in user interface design?",answer1_1:"A deceptive design that manipulates users into making unintended choices",answer1_2:"A user-friendly feature that enhances website navigation",answer1_3:"A tool that makes websites visually appealing and easy to use",question2:"Question 2: Which of the following is an example of a 'bait and switch' dark pattern?",answer2_1:"Using bright colours to highlight popular products on an online store",answer2_2:"Showing users a pop-up with helpful tips about the website",answer2_3:"Offering a free trial, then automatically enrolling users in a paid subscription after the trial ends",question3:"Question 3: What does the 'confirmshaming; dark pattern involve?",answer3_1:"Making users feel guilty for opting out of a service or offer",answer3_2:"Offering a free trial with no expiration date",answer3_3:"Providing clear and easy-to-read privacy policies",question4:"Question 4: What is the 'hidden costs' dark pattern?",answer4_1:"Offering users an unexpected bonus at checkout",answer4_2:"Adding extra charges to a purchase only revealed at the final step of checkout",answer4_3:"Providing discounts on shipping costs after users have made a purchase"}]},pe={name:"Web UI Design",image:`${Q}/computer.png`,alt:"computer",topics:[{name:"Typography",content:"Typography is an important part of our everyday life.

You can also look at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript this way: HTML is the structure of a house, CSS is the interior and exterior decor, and JavaScript is the electricity, water system, and many other functional features that make the house livable. Since HTML defines the markup for a particular web page, you'll want the text, images, or other embeds to appear in certain ways. For example, you might want some text to be big, other text to be small, and some to be bold, italic, or in bullet point form. HTML has tags that let you get this done.
