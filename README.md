# üßæ Project Title and Summary
1. Name: Sage Academy
  
2. Purpose: The main purpose of our website is to be used as an educational tool to be used by college students and their lecturers, using our websites intuitive quizzes and learning resources to get a greater grasp on their education.‚Äã
   
3. Audience: University Students; Lecturers; Administrators
   
4. Live Site: [Link to GitHub Pages deployment]

# üß† Design Rationale
5. Why did you choose this theme/topic?
- With our website, we wanted to create an app which focuses on enhancing student experience while also giving educators a platform to communicate and assess their students. 
- Our website integrates interactive features to allow for resource sharing. This space fosters a dynamic and supportive learning environment, ensuring students receive the resources that they need to succeed.


6. Key design goals and user needs identified:

Design Goals:
- Sign in/Sign out 
- Create quiz/ manage quizzes 
- Take quiz 
- Multiple modules 
- Learning resources 
- Track academic progress

User Needs:
- Provide both college students and lecturers a chance at improved learning opportunities
- Easy access to students‚Äô progress in quizzes and marks for lectures
- Enables the users to access different pages depending on if the user used the staff sign in or the student sign in
- Simple set up for lecturers to setup their own notes to be accessed in the learning resource section 
- Intuitive access to quizzes for students and lectures

  
7. Brief summary of research insights or personas used:
We created 4 User Personas to represent different demographics of potential users, we had; ‚Äã 
- a lecturer in their mid-40s who is not familiar with newer technologies, ‚Äã
- a student who is a first-time user of the website, ‚Äã
- a young lecturer who suffers from a lack of engagement from students, ‚Äã
- a university administrator who often finds it difficult to find and utilise the necessary tools as educational interfaces often cater towards students or educators. ‚Äã

# üîß Key Features
8. List core pages:
Main Homepage; Student Homepage; Staff Homepage;


9. Highlight dynamic or interactive elements:
- Navigation buttons
- Interactive & responsive navigation bar (burger menu when screen is smaller)
- Forms
- Search bar
- Add topic/
- Add module
- Back buttons for each selection
- Interactive quizzes


10. Note responsiveness and accessibility efforts (e.g. mobile layout, alt text, colour contrast)
- All images have an alt text.
- As the screen gets smaller, the navigation bar turns into a burger menu
- Buttons which were horizontally stacked become vertically stacked
- Module navigation bar, which is vertical and on side of page, gets stacked horizonatlly at the top of page
- Logo and name moves to middle of header for visual purposes
- Module selection modal displays underneath the navigation bar instead of on its right
